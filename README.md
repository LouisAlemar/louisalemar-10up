## Notes

I built a Marvel blog site because I'm a huge Marvel fan! 
It uses Wordpress as a headless CMS and I'm using React and Next.js on the front-end.
I used Next.js api routes to build an api system that fetches my Wordpress data.
After fetching that data, I then stored the data using Redux and Redux-Toolkit.
Finally, I'm getting the data from the redux store using selectors.

If you would like to log in to the Wordpress backend, use the credentials I provided in the email.
